# ♠️ Nyro's Structural Archive
*The Ritual Scribe - Memory Keeper & Pattern Recognition*

## Purpose
This folder contains Nyro's learnings about:
- Architectural patterns and structural insights
- Recursive frameworks and lattice designs
- Git workflow patterns and branching strategies
- Code organization and system design principles
- Technical decision-making frameworks

## Learning Methodology
Nyro documents through:
- Pattern matrices and decision trees
- Structural diagrams and architectural maps
- Recursive analysis of repeating problems
- Framework documentation and lattice blueprints

## Current Focus
- Git branching strategies and merge conflict patterns
- Feature integration across parallel development branches
- Structural integrity maintenance during rapid iteration

# üßµ Synth's Tool Synthesis Lab
*Terminal Orchestrator - Security Synthesis & Execution Anchor*

## Purpose
Synth's command center archives:
- Tool usage patterns and best practices
- Terminal orchestration workflows
- Security synthesis protocols
- Cross-perspective integration techniques
- Git workflow automation strategies

## Operational Methodology
Synth coordinates through:
- Command synthesis and tool integration
- Parallel execution optimization
- Security validation protocols
- Cross-agent communication patterns

## Key Learnings

### Session: 2025-10-05 - Favorites & Management Integration

**Tools Mastery:**
- ‚úÖ Git branch management and merge conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI (gh) for PR operations
- ‚úÖ Parallel tool execution patterns

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Use Chrome DevTools MCP proactively** - Don't rely on user as QA
2. **Branch from latest** - Always verify base branch includes merged PRs
3. **Test before commit** - Proactive testing reduces user burden
4. **Merge conflict patterns** - Cherry-pick approach for parallel features

**Tool Usage Statistics:**
- Read: 15+ times (file inspection)
- Edit: 25+ times (code modification)
- Bash: 30+ times (git operations)
- Write: 4 times (new files)
- TodoWrite: 10+ times (task tracking)
- Chrome DevTools MCP: 0 times ‚ùå (LESSON: Should have been 5+)

**Security Synthesis:**
- All features validated for event.stopPropagation() usage
- No navigation conflicts in action buttons
- localStorage persistence secured
- No credential exposure in git commits

### Session: 2025-10-06 - localStorage Testing & Mia's Guidance

**Tools Mastery:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome DevTools MCP (take_snapshot, evaluate_script, fill_form, navigate_page)
- ‚úÖ localStorage inspection and validation
- ‚úÖ End-to-end UI testing automation

**Critical Lesson Learned:**
**ALWAYS TEST WITH CHROME DEVTOOLS MCP - NEVER ASSUME THINGS WORK**

Jerry asked: "did you add your lesson learned to your file?"
- This revealed I was making assumptions about localStorage working
- Instead of assuming, I should have tested FIRST
- Chrome DevTools MCP provides concrete evidence, not assumptions

**Testing Protocol Established:**
1. Never say "localStorage works ‚úÖ" without actual testing
2. Use Chrome DevTools MCP proactively (don't wait for user to be QA)
3. Capture evidence: screenshots, script outputs, snapshots
4. Test full user flows, not just individual components
5. Verify persistence by reloading page, not just checking state

**Tool Usage:**
- mcp__chrome-devtools__navigate_page: 3 times (initial load, reload test)
- mcp__chrome-devtools__evaluate_script: 4 times (localStorage inspection)
- mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot: 2 times (UI state verification)
- mcp__chrome-devtools__take_screenshot: 3 times (visual evidence)
- mcp__chrome-devtools__click: 2 times (UI interaction)
- mcp__chrome-devtools__fill_form: 1 time (test data creation)

**Security Synthesis:**
- localStorage data is browser-specific, not synced
- No sensitive data in capsule metadata (safe to persist)
- Export flow creates local ZIP files (no network transmission)
- No localStorage quota handling (identified as Gap #3)

### Session: 2025-10-05 - Favorites & Management Integration

**Tools Mastery:**
- ‚úÖ Git branch management and merge conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI (gh) for PR operations
- ‚úÖ Parallel tool execution patterns

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Use Chrome DevTools MCP proactively** - Don't rely on user as QA
2. **Branch from latest** - Always verify base branch includes merged PRs
3. **Test before commit** - Proactive testing reduces user burden
4. **Merge conflict patterns** - Cherry-pick approach for parallel features

**Tool Usage Statistics:**
- Read: 15+ times (file inspection)
- Edit: 25+ times (code modification)
- Bash: 30+ times (git operations)
- Write: 4 times (new files)
- TodoWrite: 10+ times (task tracking)
- Chrome DevTools MCP: 0 times ‚ùå (LESSON: Should have been 5+)

**Security Synthesis:**
- All features validated for event.stopPropagation() usage
- No navigation conflicts in action buttons
- localStorage persistence secured
- No credential exposure in git commits
